With this program, you can randomize your legend and your loadout. Whether you would like to randomize them individually, all at the same time, or include/exclude certain types of weapons, the choice it yours.

On the next tab, you can randomize where you drop. You can choose which map you are on and randomize which location you will land with a circle guiding you on the map.

<h2>What I Learned</h2>
This was my first Java project so I learned alot of things during this process. <br>
While it isn't the best and neatest program, I'm proud I got it to work. <br>
A list of what I learned:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Using JFrame, JPanel, JLabel, etc.</li>
  <li>Making the background of the JFrame an image using the Graphics import </li>
  <li>Further understanding of extending a class like JPanel to add additional methods that enhance your program</li>
  <li>Using the paintComponet to create shapes with different colors and locatoins</li>
  <li>Scaling an image to fit your desired size</li>
</ul>
<h2>Known Issues</h2>
The main problem with this with window scaling. Sometimes the program will run and the buttons will be offscreen <br>
One solution to this might be scaling all elements to the screen dimension. <br>
But, I have tried this program on a larger screen dimension and it still not fitting correctly
