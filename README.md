With this program, you can randomize your legend and your loadout. Whether you would like to randomize them individually, all at the same time, or include/exclude certain types of weapons, the choice it yours.

<h2>Known Issues</h2>
The main problem with this with window scaling. Sometimes the program will run and the buttons will be offscreen <br>
One solution to this might be scaling all elements to the screen dimension. <br>
But, I have tried this program on a larger screen dimension and it still not fitting correctly
